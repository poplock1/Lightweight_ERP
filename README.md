# Simple ERP project

Ligtweigt, console based ERP system.

## Features

* Adding, removing and editing data.
* Special funcions commonly used in given field.
* Foolproof.
* Generally awesome.

## Project requirements

In this project our mentor team forbid to use python built-in functions such as:

```python
data.sum()
data.index()
data.sort()

```

Due to that unfortunate prohibit we had to make our own versions of this simple functions and that happened to be not that easy as it seemed.

Now I can proudly say that I really understand quicksort algorihm, so the effort paid off.

Program also passes all tests given by our lecturers.
